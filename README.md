## What is fuff?

ffuf is a fast web fuzzer (literally stands for fuzz faster u fool) written in Go that allows typical directory discovery, virtual host discovery (without DNS records) and GET and POST parameter fuzzing.

This program is useful for pentesters, ethical hackers and forensics experts. It also can be used for security tests.

## Using ffuf

### ffuf has a ton of capability including:

1. Finiding hidden directories and paths via brute force
2. Testing query parameters for bugs or injections
3. Fuzzing the request bodyâ€”great for login forms or API payloads (bypassing auth potentially).
4. Testing for header-based bypasses or secrets (e.g. X-API-Key, Host).

### It also has a ton of helpful cli options that can be found by running:

```
ffuf -h
```

## Tutorial

We will now walk through a few examples of how this tool can be used in practice.
